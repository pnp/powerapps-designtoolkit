# Power Apps Design Toolkit

> The Power Apps Design Toolkit is a curated repository of Power Apps UI Guidance and Components that you can plug and play into your apps to transform your design.

Our objective is to make it easier for makers to build design-consistent, performant and accessible Power Apps. To help you achieve this, you'll find

- Curated high-quality component-libraries providing you with a complete set of UI elements ready to be used in your own canvas apps that follow a consistent design pattern
- Guidance on industry standard design practices to advance your own development skills
- See the art of the possible and get inspiration from different UI's

## Why does it matter?

> Low Code should not mean low standards!

We collected information on our main design goals:

- [Accessibility](docs/accessibility.md)
- [Design consistency](docs/design-consistency.md)
